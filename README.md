Final Project Contributions

Megan: Set out the layout for the webpages and used her expertise for the JavaScript portion of our project. Selected photos for the gallery webpage and made our Contact and CSS page. Worked on the navigation bar.

Melanie: Worked on the gallery page, picked out a theme for our website in terms of colors and background images so it looked more appealing. Worked on the customer testimonials page and services page. Created the README file.

Jonathan: Put together the zip file with all necessary documents and pictures. Worked on the Home page and Eventful Eats mission statement along with adding appropriate images to each webpage to make them more interesting.

We collectively worked on the website as a team and met after class to work together to brainstorm ideas. We shared a Google Doc that we would update along the way with any changes we made.
